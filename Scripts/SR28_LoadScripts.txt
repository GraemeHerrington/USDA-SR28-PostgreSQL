# The load scripts are the individual commands used to load the flat-file data from SR28
# from a psql command prompt, as database owner and in the usda database, first issue the encoding command

usda=# SET client_encoding = 'LATIN1';
<repsonse>SET

# The LATIN1 encoding allows correct processing of the 'mu' character. Basically in the metric system there
# are too many 'm's so scientists use the Greek letter 'mu', or occasionally the roman 'u' to indicate amounts
# which are millionths of a gram. Millegrams are only thousandths, so there is a 1000* factor between 'm' and 'mu'
# Getting this wrong will render the database nearly computationally useless.

# Note below that paths are absolute, and UNIX / Linux style

# Once the encoding is set, read in each file. The file has a peculiar format, but is otherwise a character delimited
# file with character wrapped values. These can be proxied  by specifying the delimiter and the quote symbol to appear
# to be plain vanilla CSV. Lines / records read in are returned by the system as COPY ####
